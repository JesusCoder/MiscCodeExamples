/**
 * Java provides a mechanism, called object serialization where an object can be
 * represented as a sequence of bytes that includes the object's data as well as
 * information about the object's type and the types of data stored in the
 * object.
 * 
 * After a serialized object has been written into a file, it can be read from
 * the file and deserialized that is, the type information and bytes that
 * represent the object and its data can be used to recreate the object in
 * memory.
 * 
 * Most impressive is that the entire process is JVM independent, meaning an
 * object can be serialized on one platform and deserialized on an entirely
 * different platform.
 * 
 * Classes ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream are high-level streams that
 * contain the methods for serializing and deserializing an object.
 * 
 * The ObjectOutputStream class contains many write methods for writing various
 * data types, but one method in particular stands out:
 * 
 * public final void writeObject(Object x) throws IOException
 * 
 * The above method serializes an Object and sends it to the output stream.
 * Similarly, the ObjectInputStream class contains the following method for
 * deserializing an object:
 * 
 * public final Object readObject() throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException
 * 
 * This method retrieves the next Object out of the stream and deserializes it.
 * The return value is Object, so you will need to cast it to its appropriate
 * data type.
