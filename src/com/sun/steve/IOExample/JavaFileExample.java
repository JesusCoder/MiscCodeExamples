/**
 * This is a class to demo File class in java.
 * 
 * A directory is a File
 * 
 * which can contain a list of other files and directories. You use File object
 * to create directories, to list down files available in a directory. For
 * complete detail check a list of all the methods which you can call on File
 * object and what are related to directories.
 * 
 * Java automatically takes care of path separators on UNIX and Windows as per
 * conventions. If you use a forward slash (/) on a Windows version of Java, the
 * path will still resolve correctly.
